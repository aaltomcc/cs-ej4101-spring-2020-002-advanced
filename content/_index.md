Hi there, I am Monika Rangta. Currently, pursuing my Master's in Security and Cloud Computing from Aalto School of Science, Finland. 

In Aalto University, I am also working as a teaching assistant for Information Security course. I want to make my career as a specialist in Information Security and in Software Development, that's why I choose my major in Security and Cloud Computing.

I am basically from India and, I moved to Finland in 2018. I am from North India, Himachal Pradesh, which is in the western Himalayas. I live in the lap of mountains and tough terrains (here is a picture for you).

Well, Finland is also treating me good. It has rich nature, beautiful landscapes, more than a thousand lakes and one can enjoy a spectacular view of Northern lights here.

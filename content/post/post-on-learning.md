By going through the videos of the course I found the course quite interested. I came to know about the practices, currently every IT organization followed to automate the process for quick delivery.

Things I learned:

- DevOps increases the productivity of a company to deliver its services and applications in faster way. It helps companies to compete strongly and serve their customers better in the market.
- It gives us the entire view of the Software Development Process and Delivery process, how can they build, test and release software more reliably and faster
- It helps us to understand how the development and IT operations are aligned and how can we improve their communication and collaboration in efficient way.
- It helps to understand how can I improve the culture in an organization to improve productivity efficiently

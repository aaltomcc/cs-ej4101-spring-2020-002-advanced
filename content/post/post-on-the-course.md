I took this course to improve my grades for CS-E4100. My professor suggested me to complete DevOps course to gain more grades, I liked the course as I got depth knowledge about:

- DevOps culture
- CI/CD pipeline
- CAMS Model
- How to automate the process
- How the DevOps has different practices than traditional software development.


I liked the way the course was organized, videos provided the depth knowledge and quizzes help us to try the knowledge we gain so far. However, the project helps us to understand the practicality of CI/CD implementation.

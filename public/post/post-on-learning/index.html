    <p>By going through the videos of the course, I found the course quite interested. I came to know about the DevOps practices; currently, every IT organization is following to automate the process for quick delivery.</p>
<p>Things I learned, so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>DevOps increases the productivity of a company to deliver its services and applications in a faster way. It helps companies to compete strongly and serve their customers better in the market.</li>
<li>It gives us the complete view of the Software Development Process and Delivery process, how can they build, test and release software more reliably and faster.</li>
<li>It helps us to understand how the development and IT operations are aligned and how can we improve their communication and collaboration efficiently.</li>
<li>It helps to understand how can we improve the culture in an organization; if there is a better collaboration amongst the project team, it helps in better productivity.</li>
<li>By automating the server configuration, it reduces the time of resource management from days to a few minutes.</li>
<li>DevOps practices provide better version control and releases, and it reduces the cost over time.</li>
<li>Service backups improve the meantime of recovery, which means it reduces the service downtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, I practically implemented the CI/CD on this website using Travis CI and also came to know about the Hugo framework, where we can easily create our websites and blogs.</p>
<p>It was fun to complete the project. If you are interested in software development and deployment, I would recommend you to take this course, as it worth knowing how the development and operations team work together to be more productive, as DevOps practices been rapidly integrated in the IT companies.</p>

      <description>I took this course to improve my grades for CS-E4100. My professor suggested me to complete DevOps course to gain more grades, I liked the course as I got depth knowledge about:
 DevOps culture CI/CD pipeline CAMS Model How to automate the process How the DevOps has different practices than traditional software development.  I liked the way the course was organized, videos provided the depth knowledge and quizzes help us to try the knowledge we gain so far.</description>

      <description>By going through the videos of the course I found the course quite interested. I came to know about the practices, currently every IT organization followed to automate the process for quick delivery.
Things I learned:
 DevOps increases the productivity of a company to deliver its services and applications in faster way. It helps companies to compete strongly and serve their customers better in the market. It gives us the entire view of the Software Development Process and Delivery process, how can they build, test and release software more reliably and faster It helps us to understand how the development and IT operations are aligned and how can we improve their communication and collaboration in efficient way.</description>

      <description>I took this course to improve my grades for CS-E4100. My professor suggested me to complete DevOps course to gain more grades, I liked the course as I got depth knowledge about:
 DevOps culture CI/CD pipeline CAMS Model How to automate the process How the DevOps has different practices than traditional software development.  I liked the way the course was organized, videos provided the depth knowledge and quizzes help us to try the knowledge we gain so far.</description>
